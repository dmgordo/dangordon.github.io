A $(v,k,t)$-*covering design* is a collection of $k$-element subsets,
called blocks, of {$1,2,...,v$}, such that any $t$-element subset is
contained in at least one block.  This database contains a collection of
good $(v,k,t)$-coverings. Each of these coverings gives an upper
bound for the corresponding $C(v,k,t)$, the smallest possible
number of blocks in such a covering design.

The limit for coverings is $v&lt;100$, $k≤25$, and
$t≤8$, just to draw the line somewhere. With a few exceptions, only coverings with at
most 100000 blocks are given, to keep the database a reasonable size.

The coverings here have been contributed by over a hundred people
around the world over the past thirty years.  When the last changes
are made to the database, I'll add a list of the top contributors here.
