A *signed* $(v,k,\lambda)$-*difference set* in a group $G$ of order $v$ is a
subset {$d_1, d_2, ..., d_k$} of $G$ and signs $s_i$ in {$-1,1$}
such that the element $D = \Sigma s_i d_i$ in the group ring $Z[G]$
satifies the difference set equation: 

$D D^{-1} = n + \lambda G$,

where $n = k-\lambda$.

Note that difference sets and circulant weighing matrices are special
cases of signed difference sets; the former have all signs $=1$, and
the latter have $\lambda=0$.


[My 2023 paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10623-022-01171-8)
introduced these sets, and proved various 
existence results about them.
[Another article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10623-024-01389-8)
by
He, Chen and Ge gave some further results.
These and other results are collected in the repository:
