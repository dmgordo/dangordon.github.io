A $(v,k,\lambda)$-difference set in a group $G$ is a subset $D = $ {$d_1, d_2, ..., d_k$} of $G$ such that each nonzero element of $G$ can each be represented as a difference $(d_i - d_j)$ in exactly $\lambda$ different ways.





This database gives information about possible parameters for
difference sets in abelian groups $G$. All parameters with
$v&lt;100000$ passing basic tests (counting, Schutzenberger,
Bruck-Ryser-Chowla) are
listed here, and an attempt has been made to include all known
difference sets. Most known for large $v$ are Paley, which are easily
constructed, so those are omitted for $v&gt;1000$.
